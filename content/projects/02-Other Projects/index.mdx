**TO DO LIST**<br />
Everyone needs a TO DO LIST in their life -- and most developers have built one at some point along their journey.  
Here is my spin on the conventional application using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

My main goals were:
1) To build a 'Create, Read, Update, and Delete **(CRUD)**' application.
2) To design a user-friendly experience.
3) To produce an application from scratch (no templates or Bootstrap).
3) To learn as much as possible through trial and error!

The application can be accessed [**here.**](https://paul-matthew.github.io/To-Do-List/)

Enjoy!

import v from './ToDo3.mp4';

<video type='video/mp4' id="todovideo" width="100%" height="auto" controls autoplay="autoplay" muted loop playsinline="playsinline">
  <source src={v} />
</video>

**SPOTIFY API**<br />

The goal of this project was to create an **API** application that could fetch data from an online database and return outputs based on user selection.
This application was made using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Javascript. <br />  
The work in progress baseline version can be found [**here.**](https://paul-matthew.github.io/Spotify-API/)
