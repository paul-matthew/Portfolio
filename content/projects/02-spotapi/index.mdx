Coming soon...<br />
The goal of this project was to create an **API** application that could fetch data from an online database and return outputs based on user selection.
This application was made using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Javascript.  
The work in progress baseline version can be found [**here.**](https://paul-matthew.github.io/Spotify-API/)
