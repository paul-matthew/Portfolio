**TRAVEL CONSULTATION BUSINESS**<br /> 
Travel is an invesment in yourself ✈️.  This was a passion project, mixing a hobby with web development.<br />

The goal of this project was to create a **Landing Page** application using Bootstrap templates for the framework and customize accordingly.  This Bootstrap template uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript.  
The application can be accessed [**here.**](https://paul-matthew.github.io/Travel-Whisper/)

**FINE DINING RESTAURANT**<br />
Elevating the dining experience goes beyond the confines of a restaurant—it begins even before you step through the door. With this in mind, this passion project looked to integrate seamlessly blending the world of fine dining with the art of web development.<br />

The objective was to design a user-friendly and immersive website for a new, upscale dining establishment. To achieve this, I employed Bootstrap templates as the foundation, which I then customized to reflect the unique ambiance and essence of the restaurant. Our implementation involved utilizing HTML, CSS, and Javascript to bring the vision to life.
