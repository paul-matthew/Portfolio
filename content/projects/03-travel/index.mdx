Travel is an invesment in yourself ✈️.  This was a passion project for me, mixing a hobby with web development.<br />

The goal of this project was to create a **Landing Page** application using Bootstrap templates for the framework and customize accordingly.  This Bootstrap template uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript.  
The application can be accessed [**here.**](https://paul-matthew.github.io/Travel-Whisper/)
