Everyone needs a TO DO LIST in their life -- and most developers have built one at some point along their journey!  
Here is my spin on the conventional application using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

My main goals were:
1) To create a Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) application.
2) To design a user-friendly experience.
3) To produce an application from scratch (no templates or Bootstrap!).
3) To learn as much as possible through trial and error!

The application can be accessed [**here**](https://paul-matthew.github.io/To-Do-List/)

Enjoy!
